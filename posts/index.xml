      <description>Obtaining PSSH Getting started 3 methods to find PSSH:
The simplest one: PSSH is clearly indicated in MPD file. Download MPD file (browser add-on &amp;ldquo;MPD Detector&amp;rdquo; will give you MPD link or filtering for mpd in the network tab of devoloper tools (ctrl + shift + c)), open it with Notepad, search for pssh value.
If there is KID, but no PSSH in MPD, calculate PSSH by using KID:
Using this website you can get the PSSH by entering in the urn:uuid: into the System ID field and entering the cenc:default_KID= into the KEY IDs field without the quotes &amp;quot;&amp;quot;</description>

      <description>Purpose of this project Hello everyone! Hope all is good. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past few months scouring pages just to try and get decryption keys for widevine content. There was no clear instructions on the internet and the instructions that are there need pieced togther for a proper result. What I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do is condense these fragments down to a cohesive guide for people to follow. If you have any questions feel free to message me on here, my reddit or discord, contact information can be found on my profile.</description>

      <description>The CDM Project The CDM Project was a set of tools and guides used for testing Widevine DRM on multiple websites &amp;amp; platforms. I used it to learn how Widevine works and how I can avoid getting my content easily downloaded.
The cdm-project.com website has been down for a few months now and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s coming back up anytime soon. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting the backup I have. I hope it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get taken down.</description>
